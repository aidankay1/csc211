// AIDAN NOTE: under connection type 8, the 3 blobs in grid.txt become one big blob because they are touching diagonally

* At starting cell, check either the four or eight surrounding cells, being mindful of the edges
* Add each surrounding, filled cell to a shared set
    * Pointer to set should be passed between calls
* Repeat recursively for each surrounding cell
* If all surrounding, filled cells already exist in the set, return
* Number of cells in blob = number of elements in set

Grid access:
* grid is 8x8
* we want to access the cell at row = 3, col = 4
* would need to go to grid[19]
* formula: grid[(total_rows * (row - 1)) + (col - 1)]
