Question 1:
-----------
Save the variable i to a different variable and then add 1 to that variable, then make a cout statement and print the new variable.

Question 2:
-----------
Set the conditional to a parameter that the loop will never meet.

Question 3:
-----------
This would output an infinite loop it would keep printing out the number 22, to fix this you would remove --i.

Question 4:
-----------
This loop runs infinitely because there's nothing to change the "true" condition to false. You can change the "continue" to "break" and the loop will end when i == 10.

Question 5:
-----------
The for loop has a semi colon after it so the loop does not execute the line below it.

Question 6:
-----------
The while loop will never run because !i evaluates to false. Nothing will be printed to cout because i will never equal 10. To fix this, change !i to i in the loop definition

Question 7:
-----------
140
