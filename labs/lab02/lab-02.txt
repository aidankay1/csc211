Question 1:
-----------
Tying your shoes, making a peanut butter sandwich, brushing your teeth


Question 2:
-----------
Internet Search, data sorting, math formulas, and sorting lists


Question 3:
-----------
Set counter to zero
As long as counter is less than 100:
    check if the counter divided by 2 leaves a remainder of zero
        print counter
        add 1 to the counter
    if the previous is not satisfied
        add 1 to the counter
Terminate


Question 4:
-----------
Get number from user
Store it in variable named num
If num is 0 or 1
    Print false
Set integer a equal to 2 and add 1 as long as it is less than or equal to num
    If num divided by a produces a remainder, print false
    If num divided by a produces a remainder, print true
Terminate program


Question 5:
-----------
get number from the user and save as a variable called num
create variable called total
as long as num does not equal 0
    add num - 1 to the total
print total
terminate program


Question 6:
-----------
Get character to replace and store in variable called oldChar
Get character to replace with and store in variable called newChar
Get word and store in variable called word
For each character in word
    if current character is oldChar
        set current character to newChar
Terminate


Question 7:
-----------
Get data/list of numbers (preferrably as an array)
Initialize variable numMax
Set maxNum to the first number
Initialize counter variable and loop through array of numbers, iterating for every individual number/data point
     If the current number on the counter is greater than numMax
          Set numMax to the current number the counter is on
Return value of numMax once the entire list has been itterated through
Terminate program


Question 8:
-----------
Get the list of number in the series
Create a for loop
Loop through the numbers in the series
    for each number within the series subtract one and set it equal to a variable(list) to that position index
return the new variable


Question 9:
-----------
Answer would be 1 because the two numbers are classified as integers so even though the answer should be 1.75 because its an integer, it is rounded down to its floor which is 1.


Question 10:
-----------
Int: ints were used to get and perform calculations with basic numbers that didn't need decimals
Double: double was used in programs 1, 2, and 5. This is because those programs do calculations with and return decimals, which int can't do
String: strings are useful for storing text data, such as someone's name. They are also good for performing iterations, as in program 3


Question 11:
-----------
A compiler translates the human written code of a program into a language that the machine can understand so that the program can then be run.
A compiler also checks the program for syntax errors and returns these to the user.


Question 12:
-----------
G++
